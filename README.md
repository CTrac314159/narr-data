# narr-data
This project contains two separate functions for plotting meteorological data from the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) project. Metadata is available at
https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.narr.html . The first function plots the wind speed and geopotential height at a vertical pressure level, while the second
function plots the 10-meter wind speed and the 2-meter dewpoint temperature. Additional functions for other variables and/or pressure levels can be added, as needed.
More functions may be added in the future, in addition to function updates to increase flexibility when it comes to plotting of the NARR data.
